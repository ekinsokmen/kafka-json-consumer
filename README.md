# kafka-json-consumer
This is a node.js based command line Apache Kafka consumer. After connecting to the kafka server, it consumes messages from given topic and converts the JSON payload to Javascript object. The payload (value) of the consumed message is provided as a variable named `msg`. The Kafka message itself is provided as a variable named `kafkaMsg`. These variables are use to prepare the output for the consumed message given with `--path or -p` argument.
